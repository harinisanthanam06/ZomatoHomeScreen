             Rakhi kumar has been on the national art scene for nearly four decades. His experimentation with visual imageries has earned him a distinctive place in the contemporary art world. Looking at his creative oeuvre one may marvel at the artist\'s deep sense of yearning to fathom out newer formal entities and configurations that appear on his canvases. Aesthetic serenity of colours, tonal variations, and the delicately balanced forms often juxtaposed on one another, are the hallmarks of a large number of works done by the artist. His most recent non-narrative works, mostly done in acrylic on canvas or paper, resonate with a brooding silence that invites the viewer into the realm of the \'virtual space\'.

SULEKHA CHOWDURY once said of her art, I worked on the canvas. In this I brought in the economical standard of life around me. I wished to portray how different the life of the common man is compared to the standard he wishes to maintain.
Sulekhas work focuses on the figure and landscapes. Morality is a recurrent theme in her paintings.
